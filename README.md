## Currently supported plane-wave codes

At the moment, BandUP can parse wavefunctions generated by: 

  * [VASP](http://www.vasp.at)
  * [Quantum ESPRESSO](http://www.quantum-espresso.org)
  * [ABINIT](http://www.abinit.org)
  * [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org)
    (tested with the academic version; currently only 
     available on request)  
                   
If you would like **support to other plane-wave (PW) code(s)** to be
added to BandUP, then:

  * Please **send me a subroutine that reads the wavefunctions
    produced by your PW code**. Take a look at the routines we
    have already implemented for the supported PW codes to have
    an idea of how your subroutine's interface should look
    like. I am more than happy to assist you with this.
  * If you don't know how to write such a subroutine, then,
    of course, I'll do my best to help you out anyway, so
    please contact me. Due to limitations in time and resources, 
    however, I unfortunately cannot guarantee to be able to do
    this as quickly as you (and I, for that matter) would wish.

## How to compile BandUP

Run the `build` script:
   
                   ./build 
             
A symlink named `bandup` will be created, in the same directory, if
compilation is successful. This is a **single executable that wraps
all BandUP main functionalities**:

  * Getting **SC-Kpoints pre-unfolding** (task `kpts-sc-get`)
  * Actual **unfolding** code (task `unfold`)
  * **Plotting** (task `plot`)
  * **Atom/orbital-decomposed unfolded band structure** 
    (task `projected-unfold`, currently only available for VASP)

If installation doesn't go well, please double-check the system
requirements (below) and make sure they have all been fulfilled. 
If you still cannot install BandUP after having done this, then
please contact us. But I insist: **Check the system requirements 
first**. Most installation problems reported to us are caused
by failure to do so!

   
For more information (usage, choosing compilers, etc.), please run:
     
                   ./build -h

## How to use BandUP

**The easiest way to understand how BandUP works** is by going 
through the [**examples under the `tutorial` directory**](tutorial).

If you **keep the directory structure used in the examples**,
BandUP will look for input/output files in the appropriate 
directories (`step_1*`, `step_2*`, etc.). Otherwise, you'll need 
to copy/link them manually to wherever you intend to run BandUP,
or, alternatively, you'll need to use the task-specific options
to inform BandUP about the location of these files (see below).

The **general syntax for bandup** is (since v3.0.0):
                    
                   bandup <task> <task_options>

For **help about available tasks and general usage**, please run: 
   
                   bandup -h 

For **help about a particular task**, please run:
   
                   bandup <task> -h 
       
If what you wish BandUP to do is **not covered in the tutorials,
and** information about it is **not available through the use of
the `-h` options** discussed above, then please contact us.

<!-- =========================================================== -->
## System requirements:

   * Unix environment
       * *Preferably* Linux 
   * Fortran 95 and C compilers
       * Preferably Intel compilers (`ifort` and `icc`), v>=15.0.3
       * Should work with GNU compilers (`gfortran` and `gcc`) v>=5.2
   * Python 2.X (X>=7) (NB: Mandatory since BandUP V3.0.0)
       * Mandatory non-standard Python packages (maybe you already
         have them; **only worry about this if the code fails**): 
           * numpy 
           * scipy
           * matplotlib
           * six
       * Optional: Either PyQt4 or PyQt5
           * This is only needed if you wish to use the GUI version
             of the plotting tool.
           * If the GUI doesn't work with you, you can keep using
             the plotting tool through the command line, just as
             usual. I'd appreciate, anyway, it if you'd let me
             know should this happen -- even though I can't promise
             to provide quick assistance with GUI-related issues, as 
             everything can be done without it.
       * **If you don't have any of the packages listed above**,
         you can easily install them using, e.g., `pip`. 
         For instance,
                    
                       pip install --upgrade --user matplotlib
         
         should make matplotlib available in your Python install.
       * Standard python library modules used (just for reference; 
         this list might even be incomplete):
       
           * argparse
           * os
           * sys
           * time
           * subprocess
           * fractions
           * json
           * shutil
           * collections
           * glob
           * pickle
           * errno
           * itertools
           * warnings
       * Please let me know if I've forgotten to list any other
          non-standard python package!

## Publications:

If you use BandUP (or any part or modified version of it) in
your work, you should:

  * **State EXPLICITLY that you've used the BandUP code** 
    (or a modified version of it, if this is the case).
  * **Read and cite the following papers** (and the appropriate
    references therein):
    
>> Paulo V. C. Medeiros, Sven Stafström, and Jonas Björk,
   [Phys. Rev. B **89**, 041407(R) (2014)](
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.89.041407)  
>> Paulo V. C. Medeiros, Stepan S. Tsirkin, Sven Stafström, and Jonas Björk,
   [Phys. Rev. B **91**, 041116(R) (2015)](
    http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.91.041116)

An appropriate way of acknowledging the use of BandUP in your
publications would be, for instance, adding a sentence like: 

         "The unfolding has been performed using the BandUP code"

followed by the citation to our papers.

A constantly growing list of **publications using BandUP** 
is available at
<http://www.ifm.liu.se/theomod/compphys/band-unfolding/publications>

<!-- =========================================================== -->
## IMPORTANT: Major changes in V3.0.0:

As of May 2017, you should use the **executable `bandup`** for 
**all BandUP tasks**. This is a **Python** script that provides
an **interface** to the fortran binaries that needed to be 
executed  directly in previous versions. 

The new `bandup` script also provides a `plot` task which 
reimplements the previously available plotting tool and its 
GUI -- both of which no longer exist as individual scripts 
since v3.0.0.
     
The individual fortran executables maintain back-compatibility,
and can be found under the `src` dir if compilation succeeds. 
The older (v<3) bash scripts provided in the tutorials, however, 
will certainly not work with the new executable `bandup`.

The tutorials have been updated, and **new bash scripts have
been provided**. These are much simpler than their previous 
counterparts. If you were using the now deprecated scripts in
your actual calculations (which you didn't need to), please 
replace them by the new ones to be able to use BandUP V3.

**Note, nonetheless, that you still don't really need any bash
script to run BandUP**. The ones provided in the tutorials serve
primarily as practical tools to illustrate how BandUP can be
executed from the command line.

<!-- =========================================================== -->
## Tips (some of which already mentioned above):

   * BandUP accepts some **optional arguments and flags**.
     To find out more about them, **please use the `-h` options!**
     
       * For help about the available tasks and general usage, run:
       
                       "bandup -h" 
            
       * For help about a specific task, run:
           
                       bandup <task> -h
            

   * Since BandUP's plotting task has a lot of different options,
     I've given it a GUI. You can launch it by using the option
     `--gui` when launching BandUP with the task `plot`.
     
       * This requires that either PyQt4 or PyQt5 is available in
         your python install. If the GUI doesn't work for you, 
         however, you can still make the plots using the command line


   * **It might be handy placing a symlink to the `bandup` executable
     in some directory belonging to your PATH**. Alternatively
     (but less desirably), you can include the current directory in
     your PATH if you prefer to do so. In either case, you'll then be
     able to use BandUP, in any directory you may be working at, by
     simply using the command `bandup`.

## Contributing to BandUP

If you wish to contribute with BandUP by doing some coding, you are
more than welcome. Please [read the CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
file for further instructions.

## Please mind that:

Although we have very limited time and resources, we do our best
to provide good user support. You can help us to continue to do
so by making sure to **do the following before writing to us for
assistance**:

  * Certify that all **system requirements** are met
  * Certify that you are using the **latest version of BandUP**
  * **Make use of the help (`-h`) options**. Most of the times,
    what you need is already explained there! 
    
I've tried to make compilation as simple as possible - and it
has indeed worked fine with many combinations of compilers, OSs
and computers. I cannot, however, guarantee that it will always
work smoothly. Please contact us if you have problems with this.

In the calculations and tests I've performed with BandUP so far, 
I've mostly used Intel compilers (v. 15.0.3) and, a few times,
also GNU compilers (v. 5.2). I *believe* you should have no
problem using other versions of `ifort`/`icc`, as well as more 
recent versions of `gfortran`/`gcc`. Mind, however, that I cannot 
guarantee that this will always be the case. It is better to 
make sure you use the supported compilers (the GNUs are free).

Last, but not least: Always check the results with a critical
eye, specially if they don't look the way you think they are
supposed to. Please notify me if weird stuff happens and you
think it's the code's fault (but do double-check first)!

### Have fun!
